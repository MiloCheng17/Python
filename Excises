1. a. Memorize 20 amino acids (name, 1-letter code, 3-letter code, molecular formula, structure, properties, etc.)
   b. Memorize PDB file format (especially the ATOM part, column contents and their meanings, etc.)
   c. Examine 3-D structure using rasmol, molmol, pymol etc.
2. a. Choose one PDB file, calculate the distance between Ca(i)--Ca(j) and their distribution. Express it as a histogram. (1<=|i-j|<=10)
   b. Use say ~100 pdb files to draw histogram for 1<=|i-j|<=10 Consider proper bin size, so that the histograms become smooth.
3. For every chain in PDB, plot the distribution of N_res (chain length) vs. radius of gyration. (linear-linear & log-log plots)
4. For every chain in PDB, draw scatter plots of (phi, psi) map for 20 amino acids.
5. For every PDB, find out the ratio of the disulfide bond forming cysteins among cystein residues. 
(Information about disulfide bonds can be found by the keyword SSBOND. Calculate the distances between S--S and express it as a histogram.)
